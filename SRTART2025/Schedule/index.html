                Subcategory classification has been a central theme across many branches of mathematics for over half a century, including ring theory, homotopy theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. In the context of representation theory of commutative rings, spectrums are used to classify certain subcategories of module categories or derived categories, which are often realized as sets of prime ideals or related ones. In this series of talks, I will begin with motivation and a brief historical overview of subcategory classification, and then present my recent work on it.

              <span class="prtitle">
                In 2005, P. Balmer defined a ringed space, called the Balmer spectrum, for a given tensor triangulated category. In algebro-geometric context, this spectrum provides several reconstruction theorems in areas such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, stable homotopy theory, and so on. In this talk, I will define a ringed space, which we call the triangular spectrum, for a given triangulated category, as a tensor-free analog of the Balmer spectrum. I will also present applications of the triangular spectrum to algebraic geometry, including a new proof of the Bondal--Orlov and Ballard reconstruction theorems. The key result is that, for the perfect derived category of a quasi-projective variety, the Balmer spectrum is an open sub-ringed space of the triangular spectrum.

              <b>Anish Chedalavada</b>: <a href=""><u>Higher Zariski geometry</u></a><br/>
              <span class="prtitle">
                Many notions of "geometry" concern themselves with topological spaces equipped with additional structure. For a given space X, this structure is usually an assignment of an open set of X to an appropriate "ring of functions" on X; these will satisfy a gluing property along open sets, and thus form a sheaf. Different geometries will impose different conditions on the requisite sheaves and spaces; for example, the category of locally ringed spaces is the basic geometric structure considered in algebraic geometry, and geometrizes the study of commutative rings via the Zariski spectrum. In [DAG V], Lurie explains that a category of "locally (-)-spaces" is a generic feature of other categories which carry a small amount of structure, known as a geometry. Based on this, I will present joint work with Aoki--Barthel--Schlank--Stevenson which constructs a category of locally 2-ringed spaces, which will geometrize the study of tensor triangulated-categories via the Balmer spectrum. This will give rise to an affine spectrum -| global sections adjunction exactly analogous to ordinary algebraic geometry. I will then introduce the notion of a 2-scheme, and state an affineness criterion for 2-schemes purely in terms of a topological property. Using this, I will explain how to provide a universal property for the category of perfect complexes on a qcqs (spectral) scheme via a construction known as the relative spectrum, also due to Lurie. Time permitting, I will use this latter result to indicate an application to torsion-free endotrivial modules over finite groups in modular characteristic.

              <span class="prtitle">
                This talk is based on joint work with Toshinori Kobayashi (Meiji University). Classifying subcategories is an active topic in the representation theory of algebras. In particular, several subcategories of the module category of a commutative noetherian ring have been classified so far and are described in terms of the prime spectrum. In this talk, we give a classification of KE-closed subcategories (additive subcategories closed under extensions and kernels) for a commutative noetherian ring. For this, we introduce a class of functions on the spectrum, called n-Bass functions, and establish a bijection between KE-closed subcategories and 2-Bass functions under mild assumptions.

                Matsui’s triangular spectrum provides a new framework for studying triangulated categories, extending the philosophy of tensor triangular geometry to contexts without a monoidal structure and enabling a finer classification of thick subcategories. I will discuss its universal property and its connections with classical geometric notions. Recently, the speaker introduced a relative version of Matsui’s triangular spectrum. I will explain its construction, universal property, and the relationships among Matsui’s triangular spectrum, Balmer’s tensor triangular spectrum, and the Zariski spectrum. This perspective provides a new way to view and organize geometric phenomena appearing in categories of interest, such as twisted derived categories, derived categories of matrix factorizations, and categories of singularities associated to schemes.

                In many classical situations, the spectrum forms a functor from commutative algebras to spaces. Thus it is natural to ask whether it extends to a noncommutative spectrum functor. Several "no-go" theorems forbid us from naively extending such functors, illustrating that functoriality requires us to revise our understanding of the spectrum at a fundamental level. I will discuss the problem of constructing a noncommutative spectrum functor, including both negative results and partial positive steps toward its resolution.

              <b>Sam Miller</b>: <a href=""><u>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</u></a><br/>
              <span class="prtitle">
                Let G be a finite group and k a field of prime characteristic p. The Balmer spectrum of the derived category of permutation kG-modules was recently deduced by Balmer and Gallauer via a myriad of new techniques and constructions. One such construction, the "twisted cohomology ring," was used to deduce the Balmer spectrum for elementary abelian p-groups. In this talk, we introduce a generalization of the twisted cohomology ring that we expect can be used to deduce the Balmer spectrum for all finite p-groups.

              <b>Giovanna Le Gros</b>: <a href=""><u>SemiBousfield classes and perversities</u></a><br/>
              <span class="prtitle">
                For a rigidly-compactly generated triangulated category with a fixed t-structure, we introduce semi-Bousfield classes. Examples of semi-Bousfield classes include both Bousfield classes and coaisles of compactly generated tensor t-structures. We will mainly consider the case of the unbounded derived category of a commutative noetherian ring with the standard t-structure. In this case, we can describe the semi-Bousfield classes which come from perversities, which are integer valued functions on the prime spectrum of the ring. Moreover, this assignment is compatible with the classification of compactly generated t-structures by sp-filtrations due to Alonso--Jeremias--Saorin, and localising subcategories by subsets of the spectrum due to Neeman. This is based on joint work with Dolors Herbera and Michal Hrbek.
